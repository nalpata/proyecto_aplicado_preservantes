Introduction\\nMicrobial pathogens are the cause of many foodborne diseases after the ingestion of contaminated\\nfood. Several preservation methods have been developed to assure microbial food safety, as\\nwell as nutritional values and sensory characteristics of food. Those methods sometimes have\\nundesired eﬀects on the nutritional and/or organoleptic aspects of food; synthetic preservatives are well\\nknown for causing health problems such as allergic reactions: nitrates, benzoates, sulﬁtes, sorbates,\\nformaldehyde, and phenolic antioxidants are good examples [1,2]. The use of natural antimicrobial\\nfood preservatives—biopreservation—could ensure the safety and quality of food being an alternative\\nto other systems of preservation such as chemical or thermal ones. An excellent overview of natural\\nantimicrobials applications can be seen in [1]. Biopreservation uses natural preservatives against a\\nhigh number of pathogenic microorganisms related to food; those preservatives are obtained from\\nanimals, plants, bacteria, as well as mushrooms, algae, and viruses [2]. Figure 1 shows a general view\\nof natural antimicrobials and their diﬀerent roles in food safety.\\nAntibiotics 2019, 8, 208; doi:10.3390/antibiotics8040208 www.mdpi.com /journal/antibiotics'))"

Several preservation methods have been developed to assure microbial food safety, as well as nutritional values and sensory characteristics of food. However, the demand for natural antimicrobial agents is increasing due to consumers’ concern on health issues. Moreover, the use of antibiotics is leading to multidrug resistant microorganisms reinforcing the focus of researchers and the food industry on natural antimicrobials. Natural antimicrobial compounds from plants, animals, bacteria, viruses, algae and mushrooms are covered. Finally, new perspectives from researchers in the field and the interest of the food industry in innovations are reviewed. These new approaches should be useful for controlling foodborne bacterial pathogens; furthermore, the shelf-life of food would be extended.', 'keywords': 'natural antimicrobials; preservation; plants; spices; bacteria; viruses; algae; mushrooms; bacteriocins; bacteriophages', 'moddate': '2019-10-31T16:31:01+08:00', 'trapped': '/False', 'ptex.fullbanner': 'This is pdfTeX, Version 3.14159265-2.6-1.40.18 (TeX Live 2017/W32TeX) kpathsea version 6.2.3', 'source': 'data/pdfs/antibiotics-08-00208.pdf', 'total_pages': 30, 'page': 0, 'page_label': '1'}, page_content='antibiotics \\nReview\\nFood Safety through Natural Antimicrobials\\nEmiliano J.

Several preservation methods have been developed to assure microbial food safety, as well as nutritional values and sensory characteristics of food. However, the demand for natural antimicrobial agents is increasing due to consumers’ concern on health issues. Moreover, the use of antibiotics is leading to multidrug resistant microorganisms reinforcing the focus of researchers and the food industry on natural antimicrobials. Natural antimicrobial compounds from plants, animals, bacteria, viruses, algae and mushrooms are covered. Finally, new perspectives from researchers in the field and the interest of the food industry in innovations are reviewed. These new approaches should be useful for controlling foodborne bacterial pathogens; furthermore, the shelf-life of food would be extended.', 'keywords': 'natural antimicrobials; preservation; plants; spices; bacteria; viruses; algae; mushrooms; bacteriocins; bacteriophages', 'moddate': '2019-10-31T16:31:01+08:00', 'trapped': '/False', 'ptex.fullbanner': 'This is pdfTeX, Version 3.14159265-2.6-1.40.18 (TeX Live 2017/W32TeX) kpathsea version 6.2.3', 'source': 'data/pdfs/antibiotics-08-00208.pdf', 'total_pages': 30, 'page': 0, 'page_label': '1'}, page_content='antibiotics \\nReview\\nFood Safety through Natural Antimicrobials\\nEmiliano J.
